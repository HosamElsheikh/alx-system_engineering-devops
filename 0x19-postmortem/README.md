# **Postmortem Report: The Great Database Connection Apocalypse of 2025** 🚨  

## **Issue Summary** 😱

- **Duration:** March 2, 2025, **10:00 AM - 12:45 PM UTC** (2 hours 45 minutes of chaos)  
- **Impact:**  
  - **TradeMate API** went down **hard**—users couldn't log trades, see analytics, or fetch forex data.  
  - **100% of users affected** (traders panicking, spreadsheets making a comeback).  
  - Error messages included the ever-friendly **"500 Internal Server Error"**, which nobody likes seeing.  
- **Root Cause:**  
  - Our **database connection pool** partied too hard, kept hogging connections, and crashed the MySQL database.

### **Timeline** 🕒  

| Time (UTC)  | Event |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **10:00 AM** | **Monitoring Alert:** API error rate spiking—**traders are furious**. 🚨 |
| **10:05 AM** | Engineers check logs: API is **returning 500s** like it's Black Friday. |
| **10:15 AM** | Escalation to backend engineers. "Could it be traffic overload?" Nope. ❌ |
| **10:30 AM** | We **scale up API instances**—but nothing changes. Hmm… 🤔 |
| **10:45 AM** | Someone whispers, "Have we checked the database?"—💡 |
| **11:00 AM** | Logs reveal **database connections are maxed out**. It's a **connection hoarder!** |
| **11:15 AM** | Realization dawns: **Idle connections aren't closing**, and MySQL is crying. |
| **11:30 AM** | Temporary fix: **Restart MySQL**—API breathes again… but for how long? 🫁 |
| **11:45 AM** | **Permanent fix:** Patch connection pooling in Flask (`pool_recycle=1800`). |
| **12:30 PM** | Hotfix deployed, everything looks good. 🎉 |
| **12:45 PM** | **Full recovery!** Traders stop panic-refreshing. ✅ |

### **Root Cause & Resolution** 🛠️

#### **What Happened?**

The **Flask API was too clingy**—it **wasn't letting go of database connections**. Over time, MySQL's `max_connections` limit was reached, preventing new connections. The API **couldn’t talk to the database**, leading to **internal server errors everywhere**.  

🔹 Implemented **SQLAlchemy connection pooling** with sensible limits:  

   ```python
   engine = create_engine(
   engine = create_engine(
       "mysql+pymysql://user:pass@db/trademate",
       pool_size=10,
       max_overflow=5,
       pool_recycle=1800,
       pool_timeout=30
   )
   ```  

🔹 Restarted the database to **free up blocked connections**.  
🔹 Added **timeouts and auto-cleanup** so connections don’t get stuck.  
🔹 Rolled out a **hotfix**—API now plays nice with MySQL.

### **Lessons Learned & Preventative Measures** 🎯  

📌 **Things to Improve:**  
✔ Add **monitoring for MySQL connection usage** (so we don’t get surprised again).  
✔ Implement **automatic circuit breakers**—degrade service gracefully instead of full collapse.  
✔ Load test the system **before** users do it for us.  

📌 **Action Items:**  
✅ Patch **Flask connection pooling**.  
✅ Add **alerts** for **high database connection usage**.  
✅ **Simulate traffic spikes** to ensure scalability.  
✅ Write a **post-it note**: “**Close your connections!**” 😆

### **Final Thoughts**  

We survived **The Great Database Connection Apocalypse of 2025**. Our Flask app learned **not to be so possessive** of MySQL connections. Our team learned **to monitor better** before things go nuclear. **And traders?** They just learned that when our API is down, they actually have to think before trading. 😆  

📢 **Takeaway:** Always close your connections, and never assume **"just restart it"** is a fix! 🚀
